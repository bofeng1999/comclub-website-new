            Internal Relations is the Wing for the student body. <br>
            We are actively engaged in essential student matters, taking care of their needs and wants. Our aim is to
            be the most closely linked unit to the student body. In all our actions and endeavours, we make a concerted
            effort to plan and execute initiatives while keeping the students' needs at the forefront of our priorities.
            <br><br>
            Within Internal Relations, we have two essential components: the Welfare Cell and the Sports Cell. Both of
            these play a crucial role in promoting a student's well-being. The Welfare Cell is dedicated to supporting
            students' mental health, while the Sports Cell focuses on their physical well-being. By prioritising both
            aspects and maintaining a healthy balance, our goal is to ensure that every SOC student has their needs met,
            their issues addressed, and their challenges overcome, fostering a sense of understanding and belonging.

            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">I would say the best memory is when you successfully see a genuine smile from a participant
                of the event you oversee and manage. It may be for a fleeting moment, but that is when you feel the hard
                work you put in is worth it.<br><br>

                The internal cell pushed for some new events this year, ranging from night cycling for sports to movie
                night for welfare. As the faculty and university as a whole start to open up in the post covid era,
                we have to be mindful to prepare for events that would encompass a wider audience, given our steady
                increase in faculty size.<br><br>

                Ultimately, the goal is to truly understand the needs and wants of the student body. Take the effort to
                find out what the student body requires, and push for future activities they wish to see from the club.
                I hope we achieved that goal this year, and I anticipate the great events and direction the next VP (IR)
                has in store!

                We started off the journey not knowing what to expect, and we got to learn a lot along the way. One

                rewarding and memorable experience.
                <br><br>
                One important lesson we learnt was the importance of communication
                between us and our various stakeholders, such as our PDs and the Computing students, as it serves as the
                primary feedback loop through which we were able to further refine our events to cater to the needs of
                the Computing students.
