                I felt that this role was the perfect complement to my holistic development, since my course focuses on
                technical skills and this role honed my business acumen. I gained skills such as corporate
                communication, leadership, negotiation, and problem-solving. One of the best benefits was that I was
                able to network with various professionals and leaders from the tech industry and make valuable,
                lasting connections.<br><br>

                Of course, my team played a huge part in giving me a good experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed working
                with them. Some of my best memories were forged with people in the club, and I urge everyone to give
                this a shot to make their student life a memorable one!<br><br>

                Sponsorships - We act as the point of contact between the club and external organisations. Whether it be
                sourcing for sponsors for our events, or forging partnerships and collaborations with external
                organisations, we will be the ones who will strengthen and maintain our relationships with these

                Sponsorships - Liaising with external organisations allowed us to hone our communication and
                negotiation skills, something we do not normally get the chance to do as computing students, and
                network with all sorts of different companies.
                <br><br>
                Merchandise - As part of the marketing cell, it was fun to brainstorm and see what kind of wacky ideas
                and designs we could come up with. Being in this cell really got our creative juices flowing and was a
                breath of fresh air from all the coding.

            <h1 id="tab-header">Experience</h1>
            <p id="tab-para">
                As a cell, we had a fulfilling experience as we operated as an organisation striving towards a common
                goal. We had a lot of opportunities to communicate with external parties such as vendors and companies.
                We thus became proficient salespeople which was a fun experience, considering most of us will probably
                land more technical jobs in future.

                our artistic side and experiment with various designs that represent our club and its events. Tools
                such as Photoshop and Canva are our best friends, and we get the opportunity to hone our designing,
                branding, and communication skills! Working remotely helps with our time management, but we also hold
                brainstorming sessions to help get the creative juices flow.

                Photography & Videography - As members of the photography and videography cell, we are on the ground,
                capturing moments and memories and interacting with participants. We also have the opportunity to
                experiment, working on Humans of SoC to showcase individuals around our campus.

            <p id="tab-para">
                My experience as the publicity director has been both meaningful and enjoyable. I've had the
                opportunity to lead a talented team in creating diverse publicity materials, while also connecting
                with fellow members who share a passion for photography and design. As the team responsible for
                showcasing our club's efforts to the school and the public, it's gratifying to know our work helps
                highlight the work of other cells.

                <br><br>
                A cherished memory would be the invaluable interactions with members from both the photography and design
                subcommittees. Learning camera techniques from my photography team and discussing design tools
                with my content and graphic members not only enhanced my skills but also fostered camaraderie among
                us, making my time as the publicity director truly memorable.
